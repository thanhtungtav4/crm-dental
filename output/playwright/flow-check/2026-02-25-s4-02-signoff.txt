S4-02 sign-off note (Design token/style system)
Date: 2026-02-25

Checks completed:
- Core workspace tabs (`appointments`, `prescriptions`, `photos`, `payments`) refactored to shared tokenized palette.
- Supporting patient blocks (`crm-feature-*`, `crm-link-list-*`, `crm-payment-summary`) tokenized.
- Inline style scan on patient blade/livewire views: no inline style declarations found.

Verification commands:
- rg -n "style=\"|style='|<style" resources/views/filament/resources/patients resources/views/livewire
- npm run build
- php artisan test tests/Feature/PatientViewBladeRefactorTest.php

Conclusion:
- S4-02 accepted at sprint level; remaining refinements (if any) can be handled as incremental polish.
