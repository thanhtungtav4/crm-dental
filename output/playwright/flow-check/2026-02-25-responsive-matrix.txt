Quick findings:
- No critical UI breakage found on the tested matrix.
- Horizontal overflow behavior is present for dense tables at 1024/768.
- Header/actions and tab content remain usable across tested widths.

Open for manual sign-off:
- Final pixel-level parity approval against reference baseline (S4-03).
- PM/QA sign-off for responsive acceptance threshold (S4-04).
